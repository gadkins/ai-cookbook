we are here live in Omaha Nebraska good morning everybody I'm Becky quick
along with Mike santoli and in just 30 minutes time Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO Warren Buffett's going to be
taking the stage with his vice chair Charlie Munger the legendary duo will also be joined by berkshire's two other
Vice chairs Greg Abel who manages the non-insurance operations for the company and Ajit Jain who runs all of the
insurance businesses and as always it's pretty big crowd here lots and lots of people and a few people you might notice
too Tim Cook is here Apple of course is still berkshire's largest holding big big part of its portfolio there you see
him backstage getting ready to go out and take his seat he gets to sit down in the special seats by the way that's
Debbie pasonic Warren's assistant who's standing by just went bite beside him also in the crowd Bill Murray he has
been here for a couple of days been hanging around you can check out he is taking a seat right now too some other
big people who are expected to be here some well-known names Jane Frazier who's the city CEO Ruth parat of alphabet
she's actually here I did and see her a little earlier and by the way this was a scene just a short time ago as the
Berkshire shareholders who were first in line started streaming onto the floor Mike this is like um Black Friday used
to be yeah day after Thanksgiving people waiting lining up these were the doors
um yeah it was a big rush they opened and everybody comes running in and it's not just because of the rain outside absolutely if it's a massive Arena
Convention Center so people know and uh I don't know what time do they start lining up I looked out the window at 5
30 and I thought huh that's not as big of a crowd as I've seen in years past but then I realized it's because they
changed the setup for this people used to stand about 10 Deep right at the door this year they pushed everybody the
crowds down the the block because they I guess they didn't want too much of a mob scene in one place if you watched it
went for blocks I didn't realize it till I went to the other side of the hotel to see it went for blocks and blocks and I've honestly never seen a line this
long a lot of people around the convention center talking about how it's it's buzzier and more crowded in the
exhibit all this year versus last year which was the first after the pandemic of course they broke for two years so it
seems like there is a little more of a interest in uh in being here in person well they know how to time it there's a lot of news that's happening um usually
you get about 40 000 people who are here this year they've been running ahead just in terms of the number of tickets
that they gave out and I talked to Warren Buffett briefly last night he said that they had 6 000 people who
showed up at will call yesterday to try and get last minute tickets they ran out of tickets they had to go print more to
try and get people in the doors and they've never seen anything like that and as you mentioned the stuff sold out
if you if you look at some of the places that are back here we're going to talk about some of these companies but he's been running the numbers and seeing what
happened I I won't say too much now but he's been tabulating all of this up to see exactly what their sales are running
like here versus uh years fast obviously this is sort of a weird microcosm of the
of the business in the company as a whole and it's uh it's it's not Revenue neutral as he always talks about it
looks you're paying you're paying to play here you are in fact it is going to be a big day here first though we should
talk about the news at hand Berkshire is out with first quarter earnings and that came just moments ago Mike has been
digging through all the numbers on this and there's some stories to be told here there are first of all a big swing to the upside in the overall reported
earnings number uh from about five and a half billion uh dollars in the first quarter last year to 35 and a half
billion but almost all that swing was the The Mark to Market on the Investment Portfolio operating earnings though is
still a good story up almost 13 percent you know over a year up to about a little more than eight billion dollars
um it seems like the insurance business specifically Geico swinging to a fatter
underwriting profit from last year we could talk about exactly how they got there but it seems as if higher pricing
less advertising Revenue they they went from margin as opposed to Pure market share it seems at this point also on the
investment side uh seems like there was a reduction in the Chevron stake uh over
the course of the quarter you have to back into the numbers based on the dollar value of the stakes that they give you in the share prices at the time
but essentially it seems like he Berkshire was a seller of about 20 percent of that stake it's like oh
that's a big six or seven billion uh dollars worth okay and um so it's still a significant holding I think it's also
keep worth keeping in mind Chevron stock was up over 50 last year so simply by the market appreciating the the dollar
value went up fair bit well it's interesting though if they were selling some of that steak while they were building the oxy stake uh the accident
petroleum stake um not a call necessarily on oil overall just maybe
picking exactly relative value or or positioning uh within that uh also
Berkshire a net seller of overall Equity uh Securities in the quarter but the
majority of that net reduction seems to be the Chevron I think the rest of it's hard to know Apple pretty much unchanged
of course the Stock's up a lot but the position is unchanged uh Bank of America also seems unchanged too so those are
two not a lot of change in terms of the key core holder for Bank of America that's the one bank that he has kept he
sold out of a handful of other Banks Banks some of them that he's held for a very long time so Bank of America still
seems to be his favorite maybe we'll hear more about that today you would hope yeah and just maybe General thoughts about his assessment of the
banking system and uh whether it needs help whether it looks like it's an opportunity you have all these
valuations that have been crushed another thing to keep in mind uh for the quarter there was four and a half
billion dollars of shares bought back by Berkshire so that was up from 3.2
billion in the year ago quarter it's not an enormous number in terms of the market value of Berkshire which is 700
billion dollars it's like a you know what 18 billion dollar annual run rate of share buyback but they do reduce the
outstanding shares a net reduction of shares down about 1.2 percent uh year over year so you know there were
questions that came in that I've been looking through shareholder questions for a couple of months now that have been coming in on this and some of the
questions that came in is do you still like Berkshire Hathaway do you still like the stock at this price are you
going to be as aggressive as a buyer and I guess this answers some of that question some of it yeah it's it's absolutely not super aggressive uh but
it's it's it's sort of soaking up some of the shares that are out there and of course Buffett in his shareholder letter
was very vociferous about defending the practice of of being able to buy back
stocks so he does it in a disciplined way he wants to be careful about why he's doing it and what the valuation is
but uh clearly he's willing to use that tool oh the cash went up to 130 billion
dollars so up marginally total cash holder nice Pocket Change um there had been a lot of questions
that came into about the insurance company specifically Geico and you can see the gecko right now that's right shoulder uh people just wondering um
what's happening and I guess we'll dig into that a little deeper today and we've got some numbers that you've been going through be very interested to hear
the color on the strategy behind it because there was a little bit of uh you know an issue last year where it seemed
like profitability was done now pricing is up across the industry yeah so policies are able to be written at
higher prices and so that's happening across the board but it does seem you know as I say in the commentary within the the 10q that they did reduce
advertising expense and it was a big swing to the upside and underwriting earnings I mean with insurance it takes
a while to raise pricing for anybody in the industry because you have to go state by state and get Regulators approvals before approvals before you
can actually raise any of it so there is a delay we saw some a huge hit to the profitability of all the insurers as you
know prices to replace cars prices to fix things construction all of that went up right and they couldn't raise their prices as quickly exactly so it is an
industry-wide phenomena but it seems as if uh Geico is trying to decide they want to skew toward more profitable
customers we'll see if that's a theme that's going to continue another couple of tidbits are building products and
consumers margin squeeze that's happening across the industry railroads pretty flat okay the BNSF pretty flat
year over year and a pretty big reduction in consumer related Freight uh loading who needs an analyst you've
already done all the work wow did the highlights I got my little you know tape bookmarks yeah that's good it works okay
we have a lot more to get to this morning we want to give you a quick look at today's schedule though Mike and I are going to be here with you until 10
15 a.m eastern time that is when Buffett Munger and the vice chairman Greg Abel and Ajit Jane are going to be taking the
stage you get to watch all of this the annual meeting you can see it exclusively here on CNBC and cnbc.com
Buffett's going to begin the meeting with the summary of the past quarters results but like we said Mike's already
done that for you so that's your bathroom break time then he's going to open the stage to shareholder questions
and I'll be asking some that have been emailed into me again we've gotten lots and lots of emails this year more than
I've ever seen Buffett's also going to rotate through the 11 microphone microphone positions that are in the
audience too so you'll see a lot of questions being asked around 1pm Buffett will break for lunch but you get to
stick around with us Mike and I will be joined right here by Berkshire board members Ron Olson and Howard Buffett we'll also be talking to Tech investor
Ann widblad and Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby kodek who has been coming to this meeting for years he was here last year
but had to leave early because he was going to a birthday party so he left I think at the lunch break after that is
when Buffett revealed to the crowd that he had taken a stake in Activision Blizzard so Bobby found out when he was
on a plane on his way back home so he's here this year too and we'll find out if there's any new news on that at the time
of course it was viewed as an Arbitrage position because Activision agreed to be sold to Microsoft for cash and Buffett
said it was an Arbitrage position yeah exactly the spread was very wide it seemed just like the market was leaving money on the table now that it looks
like perhaps Regulators in the UK might block that deal the question is does it remain you know on a fundamental basis
yeah that would be fascinating to hear the commentary on that and then at 2 p.m Eastern Buffett and Munger will be back
on stage for another two and a half hours of shareholder q a after the afternoon session wraps we'll be back
with you to recap all of the day's action while the Market's staging a big rally
to close the week after a strong job support and revisions to the February and March employment numbers Apple a
major Berkshire holding which was unchanged in the quarter a key driver for yesterday's rally the stock closing
Higher by about four and a half percent uh on the day after posting better than expected earnings Apple now up nearly 34
percent so far this year here to help us navigate the current market environment and look at opportunities right now as
