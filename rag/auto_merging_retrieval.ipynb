        "# **Auto-merging Retrieval**\n",
        "\n",
        "by [Grayson Adkins](https://twitter.com/GraysonAdkins), updated April 11, 2024  \n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates **auto-merging retrieval**, an [advanced RAG technique](/notebooks/rag/overview) for improving retrieval performance.  \n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        " This notebook is largely based on the DeepLearning.AI course [*Building and Evaluating Advanced RAG Applications*](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/building-evaluating-advanced-rag/) by Jerry Liu of LlamaIndex and Anupam Datta of CMU and TrueEra.  \n",
        "\n",
        " However, in this implementation I make a few changes to the original course material:  \n",
        "- Fixed breaking changes introduced by LlamaIndex v0.10.0  \n",
        "- Migrated `ServiceContext` configuration to new `Settings` object    \n",
        "- Swapped out the existing example data with the much larger collection of [Paul Graham's essays](https://github.com/ofou/graham-essays), which includes over 500K words. This larger corpus makes the retrieval process even more challenging and gives us more room for improving retrieval with this advanced RAG technique.    \n",
        "\n",
        "## Why should you read this notebook?\n",
        "\n",
        "You want to:  \n",
        "\n",
        "- Learn how to improve the generated reponses in your basic RAG pipeline  \n",
        "- Have a way to evaluate the relevance of both the retrieved context and generated reponses  \n",
        "- Quantify and visualize experiments and compare them to other advanced RAG techniques as you iterate on your RAG pipeline   \n",
        "\n",
        "## Motivation & Main Idea\n",
        "\n",
        "We want to improve upon basic (naive) RAG by improving the context provided to the LLM to achieve better generated responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "With auto-merging retrieval, we construct a hierarchy of larger parent nodes with smaller child nodes that reference the parent node, i.e. a parent node consists of all the sentences of its child nodes. At retrieval time, if the parent node has a majority of it's child nodes retrieved, then the child nodes are replace with the parent node. This process ensures that even if we don't perfectly retrieval all relevant child nodes, we will still include this information in the context by using the parent node.  \n",
        "\n",
        "![Auto-merging Retrieval](/images/auto-merging-retrieval.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Summary of Results  \n",
        "\n",
        "I find auto-merging retrieval to be hit-and-miss in terms of whether it yields better quality answers, but it provides a significant cost savings through more efficient token utilization.  \n",
        "\n",
        "In my first round of tests, I observed **Answer Relevance improve by 10.6%** and **Groundedness improve by 18.2%**, while **Context Relevance decreased by 13.4%**. However, in subsequent tests, I observed degraded performance across all three metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Yet, when Jerry Liu demoed this technique in his DeepLearning.AI course, he showed significant improvement not just over basic RAG, but also [sentence window retrieval](/notebooks/rag/sentence-window-retrieval); whereas I've observed better performance in the latter. This discrepency likely has to do with my data and set of eval questions, though, I can't point to anything in particular.  \n",
        "\n",
        "On a positive note, compared to basic RAG (using LlamaIndex's Direct Query Engine), I observed a **78.4% decrease in total tokens**, while maintaining roughly comparable answer quality. This reduction resulted in a **3x cost savings**. Intuitively, we can assume the auto-merging retrieval technique is providing more granular, succinct, and relevant context than the basic RAG pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall I would not exclusively rely on auto-merging retrieval, but it would be interesting to suppliment with other advanced techniques.\n"

Airbnb\\\\n\\\\n[](index.html)  \\\\n  \\\\n\\\\n  \\\\n  \\\\nMarch 2011  \\\\n  \\\\nYesterday Fred Wilson published a remarkable [post](http://avc.com/2011/03/airbnb) about missing [Airbnb](http://airbnb.com). VCs miss good startups all the time, but it's extraordinarily rare for one to talk about it publicly till long afterward. So that post is further evidence what a rare bird Fred is. He's probably the nicest VC I know.  \\\\n  \\\\nReading Fred's post made me go back and look at the emails I exchanged with him at the time, trying to convince him to invest in Airbnb. It was quite interesting to read. You can see Fred's mind at work as he circles the deal.  \\\\n  \\\\nFred and the Airbnb founders have generously agreed to let me publish this email exchange (with one sentence redacted about something that's strategically important to Airbnb and not an important part of the conversation). It's an interesting illustration of an element of the startup ecosystem that few except the participants ever see: investors trying to convince one another to invest in their portfolio companies. Hundreds if not thousands of conversations of this type are happening now, but if one has ever been published, I haven't seen it. The Airbnbs themselves never even saw these emails at the time.  \\\\n  \\\\nWe do a lot of this behind the scenes stuff at YC, because we invest in such a large number of companies, and we invest so early that investors sometimes need a lot of convincing to see their merits. I don't always try as hard as this though. Fred must have found me quite annoying.  \\\\n  \\\\n  \\\\n  \\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\nfrom: Paul Graham\\\\nto: Fred Wilson, AirBedAndBreakfast Founders\\\\ndate: Fri, Jan 23, 2009 at 11:42 AM\\\\nsubject: meet the airbeds  \\\\n  \\\\nOne of the startups from the batch that just started, AirbedAndBreakfast,\\\\nis in NYC right now meeting their users.

Airbnb\\\\n\\\\n[](index.html)  \\\\n  \\\\n\\\\n  \\\\n  \\\\nMarch 2011  \\\\n  \\\\nYesterday Fred Wilson published a remarkable [post](http://avc.com/2011/03/airbnb) about missing [Airbnb](http://airbnb.com). VCs miss good startups all the time, but it's extraordinarily rare for one to talk about it publicly till long afterward. So that post is further evidence what a rare bird Fred is. He's probably the nicest VC I know.  \\\\n  \\\\nReading Fred's post made me go back and look at the emails I exchanged with him at the time, trying to convince him to invest in Airbnb. It was quite interesting to read. You can see Fred's mind at work as he circles the deal.  \\\\n  \\\\nFred and the Airbnb founders have generously agreed to let me publish this email exchange (with one sentence redacted about something that's strategically important to Airbnb and not an important part of the conversation). It's an interesting illustration of an element of the startup ecosystem that few except the participants ever see: investors trying to convince one another to invest in their portfolio companies. Hundreds if not thousands of conversations of this type are happening now, but if one has ever been published, I haven't seen it. The Airbnbs themselves never even saw these emails at the time.  \\\\n  \\\\nWe do a lot of this behind the scenes stuff at YC, because we invest in such a large number of companies, and we invest so early that investors sometimes need a lot of convincing to see their merits. I don't always try as hard as this though. Fred must have found me quite annoying.  \\\\n  \\\\n  \\\\n  \\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\nfrom: Paul Graham\\\\nto: Fred Wilson, AirBedAndBreakfast Founders\\\\ndate: Fri, Jan 23, 2009 at 11:42 AM\\\\nsubject: meet the airbeds  \\\\n  \\\\nOne of the startups from the batch that just started, AirbedAndBreakfast,\\\\nis in NYC right now meeting their users.  (NYC is their biggest\\\\nmarket.) I'd recommend meeting them if your schedule allows.  \\\\n  \\\\nI'd been thinking to myself that though these guys were going to\\\\ndo really well, I should introduce them to angels, because VCs would\\\\nnever go for it.

Airbnb\\\\n\\\\n[](index.html)  \\\\n  \\\\n\\\\n  \\\\n  \\\\nMarch 2011  \\\\n  \\\\nYesterday Fred Wilson published a remarkable [post](http://avc.com/2011/03/airbnb) about missing [Airbnb](http://airbnb.com). VCs miss good startups all the time, but it's extraordinarily rare for one to talk about it publicly till long afterward. So that post is further evidence what a rare bird Fred is. He's probably the nicest VC I know.  \\\\n  \\\\nReading Fred's post made me go back and look at the emails I exchanged with him at the time, trying to convince him to invest in Airbnb. It was quite interesting to read. You can see Fred's mind at work as he circles the deal.  \\\\n  \\\\nFred and the Airbnb founders have generously agreed to let me publish this email exchange (with one sentence redacted about something that's strategically important to Airbnb and not an important part of the conversation). It's an interesting illustration of an element of the startup ecosystem that few except the participants ever see: investors trying to convince one another to invest in their portfolio companies. Hundreds if not thousands of conversations of this type are happening now, but if one has ever been published, I haven't seen it. The Airbnbs themselves never even saw these emails at the time.  \\\\n  \\\\nWe do a lot of this behind the scenes stuff at YC, because we invest in such a large number of companies, and we invest so early that investors sometimes need a lot of convincing to see their merits. I don't always try as hard as this though. Fred must have found me quite annoying.  \\\\n  \\\\n  \\\\n  \\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\nfrom: Paul Graham\\\\nto: Fred Wilson, AirBedAndBreakfast Founders\\\\ndate: Fri, Jan 23, 2009 at 11:42 AM\\\\nsubject: meet the airbeds  \\\\n  \\\\nOne of the startups from the batch that just started, AirbedAndBreakfast,\\\\nis in NYC right now meeting their users.  (NYC is their biggest\\\\nmarket.) I'd recommend meeting them if your schedule allows.  \\\\n  \\\\nI'd been thinking to myself that though these guys were going to\\\\ndo really well, I should introduce them to angels, because VCs would\\\\nnever go for it.

VCs miss good startups all the time, but it's extraordinarily rare for one to talk about it publicly till long afterward. So that post is further evidence what a rare bird Fred is. He's probably the nicest VC I know.  \\\\n  \\\\nReading Fred's post made me go back and look at the emails I exchanged with him at the time, trying to convince him to invest in Airbnb. It was quite interesting to read. You can see Fred's mind at work as he circles the deal.  \\\\n  \\\\nFred and the Airbnb founders have generously agreed to let me publish this email exchange (with one sentence redacted about something that's strategically important to Airbnb and not an important part of the conversation). It's an interesting illustration of an element of the startup ecosystem that few except the participants ever see: investors trying to convince one another to invest in their portfolio companies. Hundreds if not thousands of conversations of this type are happening now, but if one has ever been published, I haven't seen it. The Airbnbs themselves never even saw these emails at the time.  \\\\n  \\\\nWe do a lot of this behind the scenes stuff at YC, because we invest in such a large number of companies, and we invest so early that investors sometimes need a lot of convincing to see their merits. I don't always try as hard as this though. Fred must have found me quite annoying.  \\\\n  \\\\n  \\\\n  \\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\nfrom: Paul Graham\\\\nto: Fred Wilson, AirBedAndBreakfast Founders\\\\ndate: Fri, Jan 23, 2009 at 11:42 AM\\\\nsubject: meet the airbeds  \\\\n  \\\\nOne of the startups from the batch that just started, AirbedAndBreakfast,\\\\nis in NYC right now meeting their users.

It's an interesting illustration of an element of the startup ecosystem that few except the participants ever see: investors trying to convince one another to invest in their portfolio companies. Hundreds if not thousands of conversations of this type are happening now, but if one has ever been published, I haven't seen it. The Airbnbs themselves never even saw these emails at the time.  \\\\n  \\\\nWe do a lot of this behind the scenes stuff at YC, because we invest in such a large number of companies, and we invest so early that investors sometimes need a lot of convincing to see their merits.

VCs miss good startups all the time, but it's extraordinarily rare for one to talk about it publicly till long afterward. So that post is further evidence what a rare bird Fred is. He's probably the nicest VC I know.  \\\\n  \\\\nReading Fred's post made me go back and look at the emails I exchanged with him at the time, trying to convince him to invest in Airbnb. It was quite interesting to read. You can see Fred's mind at work as he circles the deal.  \\\\n  \\\\nFred and the Airbnb founders have generously agreed to let me publish this email exchange (with one sentence redacted about something that's strategically important to Airbnb and not an important part of the conversation). It's an interesting illustration of an element of the startup ecosystem that few except the participants ever see: investors trying to convince one another to invest in their portfolio companies. Hundreds if not thousands of conversations of this type are happening now, but if one has ever been published, I haven't seen it. The Airbnbs themselves never even saw these emails at the time.  \\\\n  \\\\nWe do a lot of this behind the scenes stuff at YC, because we invest in such a large number of companies, and we invest so early that investors sometimes need a lot of convincing to see their merits. I don't always try as hard as this though. Fred must have found me quite annoying.  \\\\n  \\\\n  \\\\n  \\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\nfrom: Paul Graham\\\\nto: Fred Wilson, AirBedAndBreakfast Founders\\\\ndate: Fri, Jan 23, 2009 at 11:42 AM\\\\nsubject: meet the airbeds  \\\\n  \\\\nOne of the startups from the batch that just started, AirbedAndBreakfast,\\\\nis in NYC right now meeting their users.
